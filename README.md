# MMO-server

MMO Server is a very basic javascript version of Alex Krantz's
"Massively Multiplayer Online game server" adapted from the Go language original.

The server can be launched locally with the command 'node index.js' or 'npm start' or 'heroku local'.  

The server serves both static http files from the public folder and
websockets using the express and express-ws node modules.

This repo originated with Elmer Carmona's branch of game created in Mr Ettlin's advanced animation class.
